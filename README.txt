Sentiment-Analysis-Amazon

The Sentimentr package for R is immensely helpful when it comes to analyzing text for psychological or sociological studies. Its first big advantage is that it makes sentiment analysis simple and achievable within a few lines of code. Its second big advantage is that it corrects for inversions, meaning that while a more basic sentiment analysis would judge “I am not good” as positive due to the adjective good, Sentimentr recognizes the inversion of good and classifies it as negative.
